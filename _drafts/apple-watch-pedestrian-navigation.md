Apple Watch navigation is among top advertised features[^1] on Apple's website. The feature looks sexy and very useful at first glance but is it so? There are several 'short corners' about using Apple Watch navigation. Let's review - what we can expect.

Apple Watch navigation will be constraint to:

* online connection to your iPhone => hence you can use a navigation in your iPhone - in a car - better to use iPhone then a watch navigation.
* the navigation most likely will use Apple Maps - hence there will be limited data about: points of interests, less or no info about pedestrian trails especially outside towns.

So, where is a best fit for using Apple Watch navigation feature?

Well, it is not certainly while driving car. Huh? :-)

Well, it is not certainly once you are doing your regular fitness running. You will carry iPhone already and professional sport watch. No space for Apple watch. Or are you ready give up your water resistant ANT+ - chest strap connected - gps included - sport gear? most likely not.

Well, it is not certainly with cycling same as above.

Well, it is not certainly with hiking or walking along the trail. Why? Well, check out Apple Maps if they have your trail at all.

Well, you are a tourist abroad and you need to navigate
to a point of interest? Well, navigation will need online connection while moving. Are you ready to pay a gigantic roaming charges to your mobile operator? May be not?

Well, you are a visitor in a city you are not familiar with. Are you looking for a point of interest you know by name and not an address? Well, here it comes tricky you may find out that Point of interest database has a far way to google standard. So, with a luck yes it will fit but it will often fail.

### And the winner is ...

* you are a pedestrian traveler in a city
* you know the address where to get to
* you have your iPhone connected and online to the internet

Yep, that is a best fit for Apple Watch on your wrist with Apple Maps in it.

The question is why do not use iPhone instead? Well, it just got too big :-)
