What is Apple Watch? It is not an easy answer as it might look.
Despite it's name, Apple Watch IS DISPLAY and INTERACTION EXTENSION TO your iPhone placed on your wrist, which accidentally happened to get a 'watch' in its name. Oh, and by the way it shows also time. If you are not OK with pulling your iPhone 6 from a pocket and you are ok with buying every two years a new Apple Watch model, to not get outdated, then you can consider Apple Watch for purchase. I just would like to remind you about some important weak spots of several features that Apple Watch is promising to deliver.

What to be aware of Apple Watch?

* Most functions most likely will be limited without online connection to your iPhone.
* Siri - are you non native speaker? You better try Siri before you will fell in love with the idea of Siri. I hardly know about non-native to whom is Siri capable to understand.
* Apple Pay - the idea of paying just using my wrist is superb. Be AWARE that the feature is US only currently and it is question when and how it will function in Europe.
* Passbook - is anybody using this outside US?
* Heart rate monitoring - Apple will have to deliver a technical break through in monitoring heart beat using optical sensors. Optical measurement devices suffer inaccuracy that prohibits using them in serious sports or medical utilities.
* GPS - no gps capability in Apple Watch itself. So, with out iPhone - forget it.
* Navigation - Apple Maps? Apple Maps for pedestrians? Apple Maps for pedestrians in Europe? Show somebody who uses Apple Maps for navigation in Europe - especially for walking and running. Apple Maps are so below Google.
* Daily charging.
* It is a computer - software maintenance and issues most likely will arise.
* Activity&Fitness apps - the very same you will get from your iPhone apps. Well Apple promise extra data from watch accelerometer and heart rate monitor - it is rightfully questionable if the data will be accurate enough or if you really need it.
* Water resistance - It is unclear to what degree Apple Watch will be water resistant.

Have you aver tried it?


### Smart watches - smart phone companions or autonomous cooperating devices?

Smart watches are entering arena of traditional watches. There are two phenomenons that drive watches sales: 'watches built to last for ever' and 'watches to amaze this year same as my 'necklace jewelery'. Well first category comes with high price and solid time lasting design. Second category comes with lower price and is showing trendy design excesses. Smart watches are coming from a corner of 'upgrade every second year' mentality. Are people ready to buy a new smart watches every second year? Or are smart watch companies ready to produce many years lasting smart watches? (without degradation of user experience)
I see Apple Watches coming to a market with price of 'rock solid ever lasting high prestige' watches on one hand and offering marginal watches design and giving uncertain outlook that the Watches will be technically outdated in only couple years from now (?three years).

Apple presents Apple Watch as bright and exclusive and must have part of a man's life. But is it so? Apple gave us some sneak peek preview of the watch features and overwhelming high res super sized pictures of the watch design details. Both the design and the features come delivered in Apple's posh marketing wrap and successfully make wow impression.
Will the 'wow' effect and  emotion last after a second, critical, look beneath the marketing wrap?
Most likely no because some features impose serious doubts whether they are really superb and 'must have' instead 'fun toy' category.

My honest opinion tells me to wait till March 2016 to eventually buy second generation of Apple Watch. (discussed [here](http://trap9.io/articles/2014/09/12/is-apple-watch-a-question/). I am still curious about Apple Watch and I want to know what is coming.

### Apple marketing about Apple Watch now

Well, I consider Apple Watch's main source of information the pages on Apple website[^1].
There is the following structure of the Apple Watch web pages:

* Overview - this page tells us that Apple Watch comes in three editions - aluminium case, steel case and gold case and two sizes - 38mm and 42mm height. It also claims the watch will be precise and will have be 'calendar' aware as we are used to on our iPhone. It also lists the interactions available between user and watches.
It declares several types of 'taps' instead of traditional 'vibration' on the watch events like messages and notifications. Finally the page briefly elaborates on fitness a health application of Apple Watch.
* Design - This page claims 'There’s an Apple Watch for everyone.'[^1]  Well, I would respond with a citation of US hero "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black"[^2]. With round shape rectangular watches Apple is going against watch market trends
* Features - This page declares 'key user drivers' in functionality. They are: precise watch, many watch faces and calendar events on the display. In co-operation with iPhone ability to receive/make calls, messages and notifications. Contact list. Something called 'the digital touch'. Activity.app Workout.app - applications to keep you informed about physical activities.
Apple Pay - NFC based payments via Apple apps. The page also shows several built in apps and opportunity for developers to develop their own.
* Technology - Maps, the digital crown, tap&press, glances - summary screens you can swipe, integration to notification centre, Siri for events, navigation and messages, the Taptic Engine, heart rate sensor
* Gallery - the page hosts a gallery of high res super detail pictures of Apple Watch.
* Films - the page host a gallery of Apple Watch promo clips.
* Apple Watch - the page hosts pictures dedicated to this edition of Apple Watches.
* Apple Watch Sport - the page hosts pictures dedicated to this edition of Apple Watches.
* Apple Watch Edition - the page hosts pictures dedicated to this edition of Apple Watches.

SO, the design page expose Apple Watch design.
Reading through the features and technology pages one can get feeling what is coming regarding functionality of Apple Watch.

### Is Apple Watch design appealing?

What are the facts of such a subjective question as 'design' attractiveness?

I am not going to judge Apple design. The sales and future will show.  May be Apple has power to change people perception what is 'attractive' wrist watch design.

I want just point out several interesting facts:

* Apple has chosen rectangular design - that is surprise!
* Apple Watch are WAY ROUNDED - that is not usual for man's watches.

Rectangular design is constructors choice over designers. Why?

Just look what wrist watch designs are most popular by sales.
Except smart watches, there are nearly NO rectangular watches at eBay[^3], Amazon[^4] and Watch Store[^5].

Having that in combination that Android smart watches competitors already chosen rectangular shape for their watches - why Apple chose rectangular also? I don't get it.

There are NO rectangular wrist watches in top sales watches models these days!

Look at man's wrist watches design details - man's watches are NOT SO ROUNDED - as Apple watch presents themselves.

Personally, Apple Watch design reminds me a design of 'calculator watches' design from 70th and 80th [^6]. :-))

My conclusion is that Apple Watch design is going against 'everything' popular in watch market for at least last two decades.

Yet another articles about popular watch designs here[^7] and here[^8].

I am looking forward how people will adopt Apple Watch design. I am VERY curious.
## Thoughts over the feature list

### Integration with iPhone's calendar, contacts, calls and messages.

The integration of communication to watches at wrist is clear positive and useful enhancement. But understand iPhone 6 is going to be too big to pull often from a pocket (once you managed to stash it there). So, Apple Watch is going to be sort of 'highly recommended' for iPhone 6 users.

Showing calendar info, messages, nitifications and calls on a wrist is certainly enhancement and added value in experience for sure.

### Charging

Most likely you will need charge it daily. Prepare for that.

### Wourkout and Activity apps


Well, it is sure that several functionality of these app will require iPhone. ¨well, having iPhone alredy with the apps .... Hardly can find added value and enhanced user experience. Ofcource

### The Taptic Engine

### Accelerometer


### Heart beat monitoring - optically?


### GPS data - only from your iPhone

### Navigation - for car navigation iPhone do better

### Navigation - for pedestrians with Apple Maps? Nope.

### Apple Pay - in the US and Europe?

### Siri - for non native speakers and in Europe?

### What is Apple Watch really promising to deliver?

Place here a comparition table.

### Way to success for Apple Watch? To become a status

Design and time measurement wise ordinary watches beat the smart watches in general and including Apple Watch.

Sport utility wise - carrying iPhone and real sport watch with heart chest sensor is most likely far better choice.

Maintenance, operational costs and watches life time - well smart phones are now real 'consumer' goods with high maintenance - daily charging, potential software issues,

having under par sensor for heart rate?
I do not know - really not.


Apple Watch are tide to iPhone without it will become
