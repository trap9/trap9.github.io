There are rumors, floating around this year over the internet, saying, that the next generation of Macbook Airs product line will feature only 12" retina display size model, while keeping the 11" model mobility(aka dimensions and weight) and computing power of 13" model[^1][^2]. Well, if the rumors are correct then it looks like 'everybody wins' situation. But is it a win for everybody, so?

### Why 12" retina is not better then old 13" display in some cases?

I can imagine users that work with a long texts - editors and writers, but mainly editors working with revisions.

I have experience with people that work reviewing large texts. They read fast and need go back and forth while doing changes. So, one could say - hey - higher resolution - more content - doing a little bit of counting retina display in 12" can bring 60% more pixels in hight comparing to 13" non retina Macbook Air.

Hold on, 60% more pixels? Thats great more space! Not so fast, do you want 60% (even more) smaller texts? Would you be able read it at all? hmmm

I noticed that many editors even use 100%+ size of their texts while doing revisions even on 13". Such people perhaps will not gain from retina 12" at all.

Another group of users are people like myself. People that have their workflow dependent on working in two(or more) windows open&visible simultaneously. I am struggling to place two windows already on 13" display - both windows are text oriented. So, I cannot utilize 60% pixels gain and just use smaller windows in centimeters.

#### 1. I can not imagine to utilize my two simultaneous windows workflow on 12" display.

#### 2. Fast readers & text reviewers will have less text visible on the display, because size text matters in millimeters most not pixels.

### What might be a rationale behind going only with 12" display?

* for some reason retina display cannot fit into 11" form factor - it would make no sense to have 11" non-retina and 13" retina. Is it so? Well, Apple already has it in Macbook Pro line. So, this is not most likely the reason.
* It is production, distribution and sales more effective to have less options. Yes, it might be good reason to keep margins high. So, it might be the reason. But there also one more fact to consider ...
* Macbook Air starts with a lower price and if upgraded to Macbook Pro 13" retina specs, Air costs nearly same money and still has a slightly more mobility [^3]. What does it say?

### Imagine ...

Macbook Air 13" upgraded with retina display under current(or similar pricing situation and other specs). Where it puts situation between Macbook Pro 13" and Macbook Air 13"? Air will be still a little bit more mobile, starting with lower price and upgraded will be having same price for very similar computing power.

Macbook Air 13" retina would cannibalize significantly Macbook Pro 13" product model. Well, it would make it almost redundant.

So, the plausible decision would be to steer Macbook Air line towards mobility (to have only smaller display) and leave productivity up to Macbook Pros.

It just make me nervous, I am used to buy 13" Macbook Airs that have better mobility, similar specs and better price comparing to entry 13" Macbook Pros, which is my niche, rumored to vanish :-(
