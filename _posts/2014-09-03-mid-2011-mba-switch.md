In January 2012, my second mba arrived and I was happy from the beginning. It was elegant, powerful and a sexy piece of metal. I stick to this 4GB RAM - 250 GB SSD beast up to now. But every autumn since, I am becoming restless - I would like to get a new, better mba.
But I need solid 'business case' to convince my rational myself before I buy one. Have I been given enough reasons from Apple up to now? Nope.

### So, should I switch my mid 2011 for a new model?

Well, I admit this is very subjectiv question. So, what are the priorities? What I use mba for?

I do:

* occasional programming in xcode/Objective-C or in MacVim/browser/ruby stack
* maintaining of iPhoto Library of 20k+ pictures and short videos
* basic video editing
* listening music from my iTunes library of 1000+ tracks
* light work inside virtual mac machine
* ordinary pc use cases (Mail, web, typing, docs)

I feel no issue with performance doing the tasks above regarding speed and responsiveness. Although the disk size got small for me, but I work around this, using an external usb flash drive.

So, what are my ankles of pain?

* the display resolution - with all retina around I feel stranded I wanna be retina also.
* the disk size - but this alone is not gonna justify the upgrade.
* the obsolete Intel HD 3000 graphics chip. It is not supported by games I would like to play - but gaming is not my use case to upgrade consideration - it would be a nice benefit but is not an upgrade driver.

I do not need a faster performance, I do not need gaming, I worked out HDD the size limitations and I have replaced the battery recently.

So I am left with only one solid upgrade driver or with some break through improvements in mobility of the mba that would significantly improve the weight or the battery life.

### Upgrade drivers

* retina display
* battery life (perhaps 2 days and more?)
* weight below 2.2 pounds / 1 kg

### Why is 12" retina not gonna make me to switch?
Well, 13" display is already on the bottom edge when one wants to work simultaneously on two windows displayed. I already make compromises all around to place two windows on the 13" screen. It is not a matter of the resolution only. It is also a matter of the physical size of letters that I type and read. I simply does not want to read and type smaller letters then I do now.
I am not gonna sacrifice my 'over the years mastered' work flow or my ability of fast and comfort reading to a smaller size screen.
12" retina display can attract only those users that do not need two windows displayed and who heavily prefer mobility (small size and weight to the very edge).

### Why Macbook Pro 15" and 13" are not gonna make me switch?
The Macbook Pro is not mobile enough. I am not gonna carry such big, heavy and expensive beast (despite that I admire its top notch design).
The Macbook Pro 13" has gone light and very mobile. It would be an option, but the price tag is considerably higher comparing to the mba. Comparing Macbook Pro design and HW specs to PC competition one can buy pc notebook of the Macbook Pro standard for considerably lower price. So, buying Macbook Pro HW is about paying higher price for the option of having OS X. I am not likely to pay such extra margin to Apple.

What is gonna make me switch?

<ul>
<li>retina display in 13"</li>
<li>price level of MBA product line</li>
<li>weight max +5% to mid-2011 MBA</li>
</ul>

I am looking forward to autumn 2014 - will I switch? I hope I will do :-)
