It will be four years since I have started with the Apple iphones and Macbook Airs. There are positive as well as negative experiences. Despite I am experiencing daily satisfaction with the Apple products that I have, looking back, I have realized that I had a lot of bad experiences too. More then I want to bear. Hence I drafted my own buying recommendation:
```
Before you buy a NEW Apple PRODUCT you should WAIT SIX MONTHS after the product introduction to market. Then do a research on general user experience and rumors in discussion forums and then decide.
This should minimize risk of getting into a product affected by issues caused by premature production process or insufficient testing.
```

### My observation,s based on my personal experience, could be the following:

* It seems to me that the iPhone production process is not yet ready when new models come to a mass production.  It seems to me that the first lots of devices are negatively affected by issues that are sorted out later, but should have been fixed prior the start of the mass production.
* However I like new features introduced in the latest releases, it seems to me that the OS X quality went down with the OS X Mountain Lion and later. It may be the case that there is less OS X testing because of shorter release cycle together with a high push on the numbers of new features in any release. It seems to me that Apple releases a new version first and, despite its best efforts, it starts patching the new version only after the issues arise.

### The story
Looking back at my four years with Apple, I recalled situations such as the following:

* wandering around my flat trying to get signal good enough for my iphone 4 (which I am not doing with my iphone 5)
* repeatedly loosing data from my running because the iphone 5 decided to shutdown - I was NOT HAPPY to put it very mildly.
* loosing the video of my daughter who was receiving a gold medal from her very first&winning skying race - this I will not forgive to Apple ever.
* behaving like a windows man - walking with my notebook's lid open just to prevent a slow wake up.
* being stranded by sudden battery charge drops of my mba.
* being annoyed by excessive fan noise.
* fighting with the Mail for access to my mail accounts.
* constantly receiving claims from my friends that I am sending to them photos upside down (taken by my iphone). I will elaborate on this issue in my next blog post.

### My Apple timeline:

1. Nov 2010 - I bought my first smartphone ever - iPhone4.
2. Jan 2011 - I bought my first mba (secondhand Macbook Air January 2008 with the OS X Snow Leopard).
3. Feb 2011 - I enrolled to Apple iOS Developer program.
4. March 2011 - I started to feel that the gsm signal receive on my iphone4 is not always as good as other people experience around me with traditional mobile phones. They could call and receive calls even in places when I could not. I neeedd to restart my iphone often to sign back to gsm network too.
4. Jul 2011 - OS X Lion has been introduced. My old mba started getting slower. I decided to wait for a new mba model and buy it when it is released.
5. Later 2011 - I discovered that my observation regarding iphone4 signal and related issues are valid[^1].
6. Jan 2012 - I replaced my old mba with a brand new one - Macbook Air mid 2011. It was much faster and an user experience had improved much. But not for long.
6. July 2012 - OS X Mountain Lion was released. At last from this moment on, I started experiencing weird issues[^2], [^3].
6. Sep 2012 - I bought my iPhone5.
7. Mar 2013 - I have realized the first ackward behaviour of my iphone 5 during winter skiing. It suddenly switch off and could not be started. But I did not pay attention as it happened just a few times and it did not repeat later.
7. H2 2013 - Nothing from Apple convinced me to upgrade from the iphone 5 or from the mba mid 2011 [^4].
7. Feb 2014 - I finally lost my nerve with the instability of my iphone5 and I issued iPhone5 battery complaint. After communication with Apple, I went to the Apple service. The iphone 5 replacement required me to be without the phone for a couple days. Despite the fact that I was eligible for receiving completely new device 'factory refurbished', Apple process requires that the device be left in Apple premises and wait till replacement device is sent to the shop from the central Apple service center. Hence I ended up which no phone for a couple days.
9. Aug 2014 - Apple officially releases the Macbook Air mid 2011 EFI firmware update that fix part of my issues.
9. Aug 2014 - I finally sorted out the root cause of other several issues with my mba and replaced its battery. So, my mba is again in a proper shape. It was miserable last two years for my mba and me[^2].
10. Aug 2014 - Apple officially admits issues with iPhone 5 battery[^5]. Well, the Apple plays down the range of the affected devices.

### What is my experience with the Apple Macbook Airs and iPhones 4/5, so far?

Let start with the negative experiences (to be able to finish with positive ones).

During my four years with the Apple iphones4/5 and Macbook Airs I had somehow so bad luck that I ended up with:

* iphone 4 that had VERY unpleasant issues with the signal.
* iphone 5 that had SEVERE battery issues prior the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> year of usage.
* Macbook Air mid 2011 that has been affected by various bugs: firmware, software that led into SERIOUS bad user experience and in the end, caused precocious battery replacement.

<div class="message">
I essentially can not believe that nothing from the above was known to Apple sooner than I have started experiencing issues.
I find it difficult to believe that honesty and fair play belong among the graces that the Apple can show off.
</div>

Even after all bad experiences during the last four years I am still under the influence of the 'first impression' from Apple because:

* A Macbook Air with the Snow Leopard's user experience was so above anything on the market that the credit earned lasts up to now - despite most of the credit was already consumed by Apple last two years.
* The iphone design and iOS user experience/responsiveness is just perfect for me.
* I got used to the bsd style OS X with the superb GUI. I enjoy the command line and the GUI.

### Summary?

I would like to demonstrate switch from Apple but I am not convinced yet the switch will do a better.
I started to closely monitor Apple competition in notebooks and smartphones. The competion is on the par.

So, I developed a buying rule/recommendation for me. I will give Apple one last chance with macbook air and iphone using my buying rule. If Apple will fail I will switch.

BUYING RECOMENDATION:

<div class="message">
Before you buy a new Apple product you should WAIT SIX MONTHS after the product introduction to market. Then do a research on general user experience and rumors in discussion forums and then decide.
This should minimize risk of getting into a product affected by issues caused by premature production process or insufficient testing.
