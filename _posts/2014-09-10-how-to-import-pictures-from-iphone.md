I post this article solely to increase blog post coverage on the ONLY EFFICIENT way to import photos from iphone to mac. There is majority of articles that explain import process using iPhoto or Aperture. That might lead one to completely wrong conclusion that it is not possible to import photos / pictures from iphone directly to file system. Wrong. It is possible and there is already a minority of articles that describe the import from an iphone to a file system without iPhoto or Aperture. Let me try to push back balance in the article count :-)

### How to import pictures / photos from iPhone:

```
press cmd + space
write 'preview' to spotlight window
hit Top hit in a context menu
go to menu 'File' in Preview.app
select 'import from iPhone'

voala .... do as you will :-)
```

Yes, this is my shortest blog post yet.
