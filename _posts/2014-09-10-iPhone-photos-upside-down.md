In this article I am elaborating on one unpleasant mystery I resolved recently.
Last years, I was repeatedly receiving complaints from my wife and other family members that I keep sending them pictures upside down, and they find it difficult and annoying to fix the rotation of the photos. The situation became critical last week when I was taking pictures of my daughter's first day at school. I received ONLY COMPLAINTS from my family that all my photos were upside-down. So, I finally stopped ignoring the fact and googled the internet for an answer.
The answer is that I AM NOT FOLLOWING THE APPLE WAY OF TAKING photos in landscape :-(

:-)) Is the camera in the correct position in the picture?

### Who is a trouble maker?
October 2012 Apple released iOS 5, which has introduced a feature that takes photos by pressing the 'volume up' button[^1][^2]. Which is a tiny feature with a great benefit in user experience. I started using the volume up as a trigger immediately. It is so compatible with traditional cameras!

Ughhh ... maybe it is not!!!

### Buttons up - the traditional, user-friendly orientation of a camera - not according to Apple's view

Notice the trigger button is up :-) but the picture is upside-down :-((

### Hold on - the Apple way of taking landscape pictures :-(

Notice the trigger button is down :-( - pictures will be upside-up.


## Why are pictures upsid- down in this blog post?

THE PHOTOS ARE TAKEN BY iPhone 5 WITH VOLUME UP BUTTON - UP.
I am letting you feel how everybody feels when they receive the photos.

## What is Apple doing about this?

The issue has been continuously reported numerous times over a long-period reported[^3][^4] and nothing from Apple about it.
Perhaps Apple feels elated over ordinary Apple users and their troubles.

There are several pseudo-arguments trying to defend Apple for doing nothing about the issue (shooting speed, ergonomics, technical constraints, ability to take pictures upside-down). I find none of these arguments solid enough to justify my issue - I AM HAVING TROUBLE SHARING PHOTOS BECAUSE APPLE IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

The only thing that matters is that, despite Apple wanting my money, Apple is ignoring the issue of myself and many others.
