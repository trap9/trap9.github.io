In this article I am elaborating on one unpleasant mystery I resolved recently.
Last years, I was repeatedly receiving complaints from my wife and other family members that I keep sending them pictures upside down and they find difficult and annoying to fix photos rotation. The situation became critical last week when I was shooting my daughter first day ever in a school. I received ONLY COMPLAINTS from my family that all my photos are upside down. So, I finally stop ignoring the fact and googled the internet for an answer.
The answer is that I AM NOT FOLLOWING APPLE WAY OF TAKING photos in landscape :-(

:-)) Is the camera in a correct position on the picture?

### Who is trouble maker?
October 2012 Apple released iOS 5 which has introduced feature to take photos by pressing volume up button[^1][^2]. Which is a great feature for a small cost. I started using the volume up as a trigger immediately. It is so compatible with traditional cameras!

Ughhh ... may be it is not!!!

### The traditional, user friendly orientation of a camera - not according to Apple

Notice the trigger button is up :-) picture is upside-down :-((

### Hold on - Apple way of taking landscape pictures :-(

Notice the trigger button is down :-( - pictures will be upside up.


## Why are pictures upside down in this blog post?

THE PHOTOS ARE TAKEN BY iPhone 5 WITH VOLUME UP BUTTON - UP.
I am letting you feel how everybody feels when he/she receives the photos.

## What Apple is doing about this?

The issue is numerously, continuously and for a long-period reported[^3][^4] and nothing from Apple about it.
Perhaps Apple feels elated over ordinary apple users and their troubles.

There are several pseudo arguments trying to advocate situation when Apple is  doing nothing about the issue. (shooting speed, ergonomic, technical constraints, ability taking pictures upside down) I find myself none of the arguments solid enough to justify my issue - I AM HAVING TROUBLES WITH SHARING PHOTOS BECAUSE APPLE IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

The only what matters is that despite Apple wants my money Apple is ignoring my (and others) issue.
