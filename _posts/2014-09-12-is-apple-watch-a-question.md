In this article I discuss a phenomenon of 'when to buy' and 'rational vs emotional buyer decision' applied on Apple Watch buyer's decision process.
I come to conclusion that 'rational buyers' can be at rest till March 2016 and than evaluate and decide whether to buy or not to buy Apple Watch second generation. Anything else prior that date will be pure 'emotional' buying decision.

### A way from emotional to rational buyer
I was waiting for Apple Watch from January 2014. I wanted to buy them. I was eager to start using smart watches and do my running with them.

But something happened recently, I was writing an [article](http://trap9.io/articles/2014/09/08/iPhone5-battery/) about my past four year experience with Apple products when I realized I was also unhappy with Apple products way more often then I would expect.
So, I looked at my past buying behavior and I must admit to myself that I behaved as a typical 'emotional buyer'. I was buying Apple products based on emotions at least to same degree as on rational reasons.

I made a pledge to myself - I will buy something from Apple only based on rational arguments.

### Apple Watch rational buyer decision process

The process is about to find yes answer to the two questions:

* Do I need to buy them?
* When I should buy them?

Well the first question - do I really need smart watches?

I deliberately leave the answer to this question to up to every buyer.

I want just point out following:

* It is question in general - why do you need smart watches when you have a smart phone? Generally presented use-cases are minor effectiveness and ergonomic optimizations for a cost of advantages of traditional watches. Also there is a negative factor of cost of money and time spent on maintaining and resolving inevitable issues related to a smart watch wearable computer. It is a valid question whether tangible positive aspects of smart watches outweighs rock solid costs of time&money related to them.
* Do you really understand that there are other smart watches to Apple Watch and they have also a lot to offer?
Do you understand fully that Apple Watches will be most likely locked to Apple ecosystem and Apple ecosystem is US centric - so for example in Europe some features will have severe limitations or even be unusable?
* Do you realize truly that 'ordinary' watches have advantages over smart watches and that smart watches have severe limitations also for a lot of their use-cases?

When a buyer investigates the above and still wants to buy Apple Watch than it comes to answer the second part of the process/question - when to buy?

### Lets do a little bit of counting:

Let me assume, the answer whether to buy Apple Watch is yes and the answer is well rationalized.
Actually, 'well rationalized decisions' are strong domain of 'emotional buyers' :-))

So, when to buy?

#### September 2014
Apple unveiled its Apple Watch stating that it will be 'coming early 2015'. Well, let assume it will be at February 2015.

#### February 2015
It will be a start of sale of first generation of Apple Watch.
Is it good time for purchase? Nope, because of 'rational buyer' rule, that I formulated in this [article](http://trap9.io/articles/2014/09/08/iPhone5-battery/).
So, wait about six months.

#### August 2015
Apple Watch will be in production for about six months. Based on rewies and user experience buyer will be able to decide whether it is good to purchase or not to purchase.
BUT IS IT GOOD TIME FOR PURCHASE? Nope!
Hey, Apple Watch second generation will be about to be announced.
It will be good time to WAIT FOR announcement of APPLE WATCH SECOND GENeration.

#### September 2015
Apple Watch second generation announced and will start for sale. Is it good time for purchase? Nope. Wait six months. Because of 'rational buyer' rule, that I formulated in this [article](http://trap9.io/articles/2014/09/08/iPhone5-battery/).

#### March 2016
 Apple watch second generation is in production for six months. Is it good time to purchase? Well, if a general user experience and reviews are positive then YES - DO PURCHASE :-)

### Conclusion:

Set up calendar event for March 2016 now.
At March 2016 review what is available on smart watch market. Eventually choose Apple Watch second generation and buy it.
