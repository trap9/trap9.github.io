What is Apple Watch? It is not an easy answer as it might look.
Despite it's name, Apple Watch IS DISPLAY and INTERACTION EXTENSION TO your iPhone placed on your wrist, which accidentally happened to get a 'watch' in its name. Oh, by the way, it shows also time. If you are not OK with pulling your iPhone 6 from a pocket and you are ok with buying every two years a new Apple Watch model, to not get outdated, then you can consider Apple Watch for purchase. I just would like to remind you about some important weak spots of several features that Apple Watch is promising to deliver.

### What to be aware of Apple Watch?

* **iPhone dependency** - Most functions will have likely limitations without online connection to your iPhone.
* **Siri** - does anybody knows a non-native speaker using Siri?Please, give me a contact to comments below the article. Are you a non native speaker? No iPhone or offline? No Siri.
* **Apple Pay** - the idea of paying just using my wrist is superb. Be AWARE that the feature is US only currently and it is question when and how it will function in Europe.
* **Passbook** - is anybody using this outside US?
* **Heart rate monitoring** - Apple will have to deliver a technical break through in monitoring heart beat using optical sensors. Optical measurement devices suffer inaccuracy that prohibits using them in serious sports or medical utilities.
* **GPS** - no gps capability in Apple Watch itself. So, without iPhone - forget it.
* **Navigation** - Apple Maps? Apple Maps for pedestrians? Apple Maps for pedestrians in Europe? Show me somebody who uses Apple Maps for navigation in Europe - especially for walking and running. Apple Maps are so below Google.
* **Daily charging** - no more comments.
* **It is a computer** - software maintenance and issues most likely will arise.
* **Activity&Fitness** apps - the very same apps you will get at your iPhone. Well Apple promises an extra data from watch accelerometer and heart rate monitor - it is rightfully questionable now if the data will be accurate enough or if you really need it. The future will show.
* **Water resistance** - It is unclear to what degree Apple Watch will be water resistant. But I guess there will be water resistant to certain degree - otherwise No comment.

### Smart watches - smart phone companions or autonomous cooperating devices?

Smart watches can establish themselves as a product category for mainstream users only if they manage people perception into the following:

* smart watch is not a watch, but a 'must have' extension to your smart phone.
* or smart watches must evolve into autonomous devices overlapping with smartphones in features like calls, messages and gps.

Smart watches can't win over traditional watches on the 'watches' grounds - status, portability, design attractiveness while delivering time awareness as main angle of perception as a category.

The fact that an user will replace his/her watches by smart watches must come as a 'by product' of his/her decision to go for advantages of using 'smart phone' extension. Otherwise an user is not gonna sacrifice traditional watches advantages over smart watches disadvantages.

### Pitfalls communicating smart watches as watches

Smart watches are entering arena of traditional watches. There are two phenomenons that drive watches sales: 'watches built to last for ever' and 'watches to amaze this year same as my 'necklace jewelery'. Well first category comes with high price and solid time lasting design. Second category comes with lower price and is showing trendy design excesses. Smart watches are coming from a corner of 'upgrade every second year' mentality. Are people ready to buy a new smart watches every second year? Or are smart watch companies ready to produce many years lasting smart watches? (without degradation of user experience)
I see Apple Watches coming to a market with price of 'rock solid ever lasting' watches on one hand and offering marginal watches design and giving uncertain outlook that the Watches will be technically outdated in only couple years from now (?three years).

### Apple marketing about Apple Watch now

Well, I consider Apple Watch's main source of information the pages on Apple website[^1].

### Rectangular design is constructors choice over designers. Why?

Just look what wrist watch designs are most popular by sales.
Except smart watches, there are nearly NO rectangular watches at eBay[^3], Amazon[^4] and Watch Store[^5].

Having that in combination that Android smart watches competitors already chosen rectangular shape for their watches - why Apple chose rectangular also? I don't get it.

There are NO rectangular wrist watches in top sales watches models these days!

Look at man's wrist watches design details - man's watches are NOT SO ROUNDED - as Apple watch presents themselves.

Personally, Apple Watch design reminds me a design of 'calculator watches' design from 70th and 80th [^6].

My conclusion is that Apple Watch design is going against 'everything' popular in watch market for at least last two decades.

Yet another articles about popular watch designs here[^7] and here[^8][^9].

*I am looking forward how people will adopt Apple Watch design. I am VERY curious.*
