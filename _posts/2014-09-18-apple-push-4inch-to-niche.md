Apple has introduced iPhone 6 generation of its iPhone product line. The news is that iPhones just got BIGGER. Hallelujah cries a mainstream and people are stacking into lines. Not me, I am just contemplating about where my grieve for a 4" display comes from.

We all know that Apple is best at keeping its sales margin high - likely highest in the industry. Apple is doing to keep it a lot.
I noticed years ago that among Apple's tools to keep margin up is also ruthlessly cut off products that answer to niche markets only or are not sexy enough. (first time I noticed that when Apple dropped matte displays - for the sake of marketing photos attractiveness and maybe production efficiency). Who cares that even nowadays glossy displays are worse to read outside cupertino in a  rest of world?

Well, it is Apple's right to decide over product portfolio. No doubt about that.

So, Apple decided that 4" display is a niche and followed mainstream towards 5" displays. And what about us who prefer mobility of a smaller device? Get used to it.

I am speaking about awful taste that remains left in a man after Apple decides that your preferences become a niche.

I have simple needs - I just do not need bigger display - I need mobility - not a paddle to carry in my pocket.

### Is there anybody else, out there, who wants 4" display? Write a comment pls :-)
