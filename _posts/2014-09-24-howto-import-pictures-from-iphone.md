The effective way to save a screenshot as a file, enabling the file to be placed where you want it with a name you want.

> 1. Press shift + ctrl + cmd + 4
> 2. Select screenshot area
> 3. Open Preview (press cmd + tab -> write 'Preview' and select it)
> 4. Open 'File' menu and select 'New from Clipboard'
>... name it, save it.

Yep. That's it.
