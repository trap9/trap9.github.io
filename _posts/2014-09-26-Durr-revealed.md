This article is all about one man's journey into his perception of time and about the companion that mediates the unique experience - DURR. DURR is made by Norway's designer team called skreksto. It is a bracelet hat vibrates every fifth minute. !Note the word *bracelet* because thinking about Durr as a *watch* will lead you to expectations that will not be met. I will touch 'watch' misconception later in this article.

*What is your perception of time?*

## Conclusion

Durr Beta[^1] is a bracelet that happened to have electronics inside.

If you are a fan boy/girl with budget $100 < $200 to spend on toys which you will eventually abandon sooner or later, just buy it - the attention and experience is worth of the money.

*I am repeatedly suprised what it can be a difference between every single 5 minutes I spent.*

But if you are more money spending cautious person - think twice. The **Durr** is **not Water resistant** and under certain circumstances **looses power** and becomes unreliable.

### Price tag
The price is 105 EUR. But it is located in Norway, shipping fee required - 5 UER standard or 45 EUR Fedex (thats a huge difference ?!), if you are from EU then you need to add VAT and customs fees.

Overall, the total price can vary between 120 - 200 EUR.

Which is not cheap product at all. One can buy decent stylish watches for this price range or jewellery bracelet.

### Durr purchase - tricky part - an easy misconception

*Durr beta unboxed - after three days of usage*

I admit, I bought Durr very VERY impulsively. At the beginning of September I have realized that my waiting for a new gadget to play with will not be answered (I really do not understand people who are switching from iPhone5 or Macbooks Airs after 2011). I was - nervous and lost.

Then an email arrived in my inbox - Durr beta is in sale - I bought it in couple minutes. I liked the idea, the pictures were great. I swallowed the price and sky high shipping fee.

Well, I did not analyzed all the texts on Durr page. Believe me, the text are attorney quality optimized.

### Durr arrived - misconception revealed

One day, my Durr was delivered.

*Esentially, I got this.*

### Issue #1 - water resistance
You can imagine my unpleasant supprise - it was written right on the box - with BIG LETTERS - NO ONE COULD MISS - INCLUDING ME.  What I easily missed on Durr website, I did not missed on the BOX.

Durr Beta - is not a water resistant. There is no warranty when walking in the rain or washing hands!

### Couple notes on Skreksto behavior

So, I asked Skreksto to confirm (and put under warranty) that it is water resistant to a degree I can use it all day long including washing hands and walking in the rain.

The answer was no.

I send them a VERY angry email - stating that I feel cheated by their DURR presentation as a product to be wearied on wrist all the day long accompanying me during all kind of activities.
Obviously for such type of product I expect a warranty of at least basic water resistance.

Comparing to watches standards Durr is far below any expectations.

I received a reply from Skreksto which I never received before - cynical answer about my expectations on one hand and attorney level reference to a tiny sentence at the bottom of Durr webpage.

We had another exchange of email communication and situation settled on following:

* Durr authors perceive Durr as a jewellery bracelet, not a kind of electronics even watches - application of wrist electronics devices standards is not appropriate.
* Durr authors are pretty confident that Durr can handle gentle splashes like rain or hand washing but they do not offer warranty to avoid claims.
* Durr authors do not find any misleading communication on their website.

Mentally, I accepted situation that I might (soon) loose Durr because of a water splash.

I was wearing Durr for three days and I was intrigued.

Until Sunday afternoon that I got caught by rain ...

### Bend test - issue #2
Later that Sunday I noticed suspicious Durr behaviour - the vibration changed.
The vibration interval started to be unpredictable.

Since I spotted this change I was sure it is because of the rain. Water leaked inside and is causing troubles.

But soon, I also noticed that when I bend my hand Durr gets distorted.

*Checkout Durr distortion between aluminium top and plastic body - strap fixation becomes visible.*

### Durr - disassembly

At home, I decided to dismantle Durr make it dry and try it again.

What was my surprise after I disassembled Durr - there was no water.

Well with no water inside - what it could be - and I got an idea.

When I bent my wrist, Durr gets distorted, battery looses contact, charge drops and electronics stops working correctly even if the battery gains contact again.

*Battery contacts, under DURR name, are too narrow - bending them helps to keep battery contact for a while - till they get narrow again.*

### Mae culpa - tricky point disassembling Durr

BEWARE TO BROKE DURR BUTTON!

Push button deep inside Durr aluminium top and keep it pushed inside while pulling the plastics body out of aluminium top.

*The button is actualy part of plastics body. So, if not pushed inside enough, it will ireversibly broke.*
